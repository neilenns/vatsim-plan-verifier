## Taxiing

### Air taxi

> Air taxi via {direct/as requested/specific route} to {location, heliport, helipad, operating/movement area, active/inactive runway}.  
> Land and contact tower  
> *or*  
> Hold for {takeoff clearance, release, landing/taxiing aircraft, etc.}
>
> Optionally add: caution {wake turbulence/etc.}

**Avoid clearances which require aircraft or helicopters to taxi in proximity to taxiing or hover-taxi helicopters**

### To runway or other movement area

> Make approach {straight in/circuling left/circling right turn} to {location, runway, taxiway, helipad, Maltese cross}.  
> Hold short of {active runway, extended runway centerline, etc.}.

> Caution {power lines, etc.}  
> Cleared to land.
